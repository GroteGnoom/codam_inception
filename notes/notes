		download debian iso: https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/
		make new virtual machine, use iso

		download iso directly https://archlinux.org/download/
		- actually check the shasum
		use the iso, no more options before it's installed

		now I can't boot if I have EFI, but only without it?
	start over:
		no efi
		before installing openssh: reflector? other things? I get keyring problems if it's the first thing I do. Maybe it's the time and date settings!

cat /etc/fstab //to check some mounting
df -lh //disks

sudo mount -t vboxsf inception /inception
/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: Invalid argument
error fixed by
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils

show all containers:
docker container ls -a
which outputs something like
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES

and then I can do
docker run -it --entrypoint bash srcs_wordpress
to get a shell in there

to check if config is parsed:
docker-compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml config

https://codewithyury.com/docker-run-vs-cmd-vs-entrypoint/
"CMD instruction allows you to set a default command, which will be executed only when you run container without specifying a command."
So I never want that?

RUN is to build the stuff. You can have lots of RUNs

if you do
RUN apt-get update
and then
RUN apt-get install bla
then update goes in one layer, install goes in another, so maybe the install is way later than the update

with ENTRYPOINT (or CMD?) I can do
docker run --env-file=srcs/.env -it srcs_mariadb
instead of
docker run --env-file=srcs/.env -it --entrypoint bash srcs_mariadb

mysql error logs are in /var/log/mysql/error.log

To curl nginx, make sure to use https
curl https://127.0.0.1:443

now we're working with running containers, use things like
docker exec -it e7b1e1bced99 bash

I can see php-fpm listening on port 9000

php-fpm7.   1 root    7u  IPv4  28789      0t0  TCP *:9000 (LISTEN)

and I see docker listening to it:
docker-pr 4937            root    4u  IPv4  28440      0t0  TCP *:9000 (LISTEN)
docker-pr 4942            root    4u  IPv6  28445      0t0  TCP *:9000 (LISTEN)

But I dont get an answer from the port
root@inception /m/scripts [7]# curl http://127.0.0.1:9000
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

in the wordpress container:
root@64722449045c:/# curl http://127.0.0.1:9000
curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer

that's not supposed to work. You need to do a fastcgi request.
https://easyengine.io/tutorials/php/directly-connect-php-fpm/
First set a status path in www.conf
then use the script:)
on arch the package name is fcgi
ok, this works in the wordpress container, it works outside of the container, does it work in the nginx containter? no. I fixed it, needed to do wordpress:9000, not 127.0.0.1:9000. It seems like for the fhost it is local (because of ports: ?) but for nginx it isn't local, its wordpress.

Neither <b>/etc/wordpress/config-127.0.0.1.php</b> nor <b>/etc/wordpress/config-0.0.1.php</b> could be found. <br/> Ensure one of them exists, is readable by the webserver and contains the right password/username. 

 
connect to nginx with browser
my virtualbox now forwards 8001 to 443
so if I go to https://127.0.0.1:8001/ in firefox, I see the empty nginx response I expect

https://127.0.0.1:8000/wp-admin
Beveiligde verbinding mislukt

select * from mysql.user;
shows me not host which accepts form * or 0.0.0.0. This is a problem. it only accepts from localhost, not external

select host,user from mysql.user;

apt-get install default-mysql-client
apt-get install mariadb-client

docker inspect mariadb 
docker network inspect srcs_wordpressmariadb

do not test networking stuff on stopped containers it doesn't make sense. docker-compose takes care of the network.

this just works in wordpress
mariadb -hmariadb -P3306 -uboss -pbosspw

yes they're necessary:
wordpress  | Error: Parameter errors:
wordpress  |  missing --title parameter (The title of the new site.)
wordpress  |  missing --admin_email parameter (The email address for the admin user.)

This gives me a moved permanently:
curl -ki https://127.0.0.1/wp-admin

and it moves to:
curl -ki https://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/

and that moves to:

curl -ki 'https://dnoom.42.fr/wp-admin/upgrade.php?_wp_http_referer=%2Fwp-admin%2F'

this actually shows wordpress:
curl -ki 'https://127.0.0.1/wp-admin/upgrade.php?_wp_http_referer=%2Fwp-admin%2F'

This just works, 
curl -kiL https://127.0.0.1/wp-admin

and this works in firefox, but firefox can't know what dnoom.42.fr means :(
https://127.0.0.1:8001/wp-admin/upgrade.php?_wp_http_referer=%2Fwp-admin%2F


installing firefox on arch :

https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/how-to-install-gui-on-arch-linux#1-Installing-Graphics-Driver
//pacman -S virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-dkms
//virtualbox-guest-dkms does not exist
pacman -S xorg xterm xorg-xinit
//next time:
pacman -S xorg-server xorg-xinit

startx
//startx hangs
https://cyruslab.net/2012/02/06/arch-linux-video-driver-virtualbox/

//don't know what this is :
pacman -S dkms
//i had the nox guest utils, they need to be replaced
pacman -S virtualbox-guest-utils
//I rebooted, it didn't start up, rebooted again and it worked
startx usually starts up three terminals,
in /etx/X11/xinit/initrc at the end you can remove all the twm, xclock, and xterm stuff and just add firefox
the geometry is wrong then
http://kb.mozillazine.org/Command_line_arguments
exec firefox -width 800 -height 600

to reset some stuff:
docker system prune -a

if I replace index.php by
 <?php echo '<p>Hello World</p>'; ?> 

then I can see hello world on dnoom.42.fr


/var/www/html is in a volume, so edits are permanent

after deleting volumes I need to run the mysql script manually?

then I get 
wordpress  | Error: This does not seem to be a WordPress installation.
