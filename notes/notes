todo:
	let nginx show wordpress site
	- it now shows empty site

done:
	
	install ssh
	port forwarding, my 8000 is going to 22
	install curl
	install a few docker dependencies
	apt update, apt upgrade
	install engine :https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu
	doesn't seem to work: install docker desktop https://docs.docker.com/desktop/linux/
	sudo docker run hello-world // works

	use shared folder
	sudo apt install docker-compose

	start over:
		download debian iso: https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/
		make new virtual machine, use iso
		install, not graphical, but then later you also need to say to not install a desktop and gnome
	start over with arch:
		download iso directly https://archlinux.org/download/
		- actually check the shasum
		use the iso, no more options before it's installed
		https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide
		I do not have UEFI, probably because of virtualbox
		network connection is already there, I can ping
		fixed my timezone
		
	
	

osboxes osboxes.org
ssh -p 8000 osboxes@127.0.0.1

cat /etc/fstab //to check some mounting
df -lh //disks

sudo mount -t vboxsf inception /inception
/sbin/mount.vboxsf: mounting failed with the error: Invalid argument
error fixed by
sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-utils

show all containers:
docker container ls -a
which outputs something like
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE            COMMAND                  CREATED        STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
46ecc02c5461   srcs_wordpress   "bash"                   18 hours ago   Exited (0) 18 hours ago               46ecc02c5461_wordpress

and then I can do
docker run -it --entrypoint bash srcs_wordpress
to get a shell in there
